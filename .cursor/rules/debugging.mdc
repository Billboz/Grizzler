- **Always consider and suggest Elixir debugging tools when troubleshooting errors**
  - When an error or unexpected behavior occurs, the AI coding assistant must suggest appropriate debugging tools and techniques.
  - Tools to suggest include:
    - `IO.inspect/2` for inspecting values at runtime
    - `dbg/1` or `dbg/2` for interactive debugging (Elixir 1.14+)
    - Tidewave for distributed tracing or advanced debugging scenarios
  - Encourage the user to use these tools and explain their output
  - When suggesting a tool, provide a brief example and explain when/why to use it
  - This rule applies to all troubleshooting, not just test failures

**Examples:**
- When a test fails due to an unexpected value, suggest adding `IO.inspect(variable, label: "variable")` before the failing line.
- For complex data structures or pipelines, suggest using `dbg/1` for step-by-step inspection.
- For issues that may involve process boundaries or distributed systems, suggest Tidewave and provide a link to its documentation.

## Tidewave: Interactive Debugging & Data Inspection

- **Tidewave is recommended for advanced debugging and data inspection in Elixir/Ash projects**
  - Install with `{:tidewave, "~> 0.2"}` in your `mix.exs` and run `mix deps.get`
  - Start an IEx session: `iex -S mix`
  - Call `Tidewave.start()` for a live, interactive dashboard
  - Use `Tidewave.inspect(data)` in code or IEx for rich, interactive inspection (especially for complex/nested data)
  - Prefer Tidewave over `IO.inspect`/`dbg` when you need to:
    - Explore large or deeply nested data
    - Browse application state, ETS tables, or processes
    - Debug interactively in tests or scripts
