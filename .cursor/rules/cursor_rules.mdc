description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor rules to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
alwaysApply: true
---
- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [cursor_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [ash.md](mdc:.cursor/resources/ash.md) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  - For Ash code, always reference or cross-check with [ash.md](mdc:.cursor/resources/ash.md) and [ash_patterns_and_lessons.md](mdc:.cursor/resources/ash_patterns_and_lessons.md) for idiomatic patterns

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - For Ash rules, cite or align with the project's Ash resources in `.cursor/resources/`
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules
